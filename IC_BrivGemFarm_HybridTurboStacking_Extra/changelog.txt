December 12, 2024 - v1.1.5
    - Stacks prediction handles the "Accurate Acrobatics" Briv feat that rounds down his jump amount.
    - Briv stacks gained while clearing the zone before stacking and setting up the stack formation are counted when stacks prediction is on.
    - The correct jump value for Briv is used when the 4J or 9J feat is equipped and Briv has a lower jump number.
    - The correct value for "SB stacks to farm for the next run" is shown when stacks prediction is off.
    - Max zone updated to 2501 for the Melf forecast.
    - The value of the current reset used for the Melf forecast is saved in case the game is closed.

December 03, 2024 - v1.1.4
    - Fixed several stacks prediction errors.
    - The script immediately resumes to the main loop instead of waiting the end the 5-min timer if the party is resetting or the game is closed.

December 03, 2024 - v1.1.3
    - Fixed a case of online stacking being interrupted when Briv had farmed Steelbones stacks beforehand.

November 29, 2024 - v1.1.2
    - Melf, Tatyana and Warden don't require to be levelled up before offline stacking anymore.

November 24, 2024 - v1.1.1
    - Fixed MelfActive setting not getting loaded when reloading ICScripthub.

November 24, 2024 - v1.1.0
    - New features:
        - If both Auto-Detect stacks and IgnoreBrivHaste settigns are off, the script tries to predict Briv stacks left after resetting
          and won't overstack after offline stacking. This also allows Multiple run mode to work properly with Melf.
          NOTE: This doesn't take into account the need for Thellora Rush stacks and assumes values for TargetStacks / MultirunTargetStacks are correct.
        - Added a setting to automatically heal Briv under a certain threshold when stacking online.
        - Added two settings for allowing different setups depending on whether Melf's +spawn effect is active or not:
            1. A setting to have either Melf or Melf + Tatyana + Warden when Melf is active.
            2. A setting to either stack online with Tatyana or offline if Melf is inactive.
        - Added a button in the Melf forecast window to calculate the success rate for the next 10000 resets.
    - Fixes:
        - The script always goes back one zone after stacking online if the current zone has not been completed.
        - The script doesn't throw an error when using an AHK version that doesn't have VerCompare() (1.1.36+).
